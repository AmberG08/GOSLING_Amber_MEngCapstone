This repository contain the codes for the MEng Capstone project titled: Pioneering Conformalised Regression Models in Downstream
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by Amber Gosling

The files are named in the convention: targetvariable_method_versionno.py python files or .ipynb for colab files.
The lstm and gru models were genertated in the same python file, changing between the methods was done by changing the model layer between model1.add(LSTM(64)) and model1.add(GRU(64)) as required.
The files labeled original contain the LSTM/GRU models without feature selection.
